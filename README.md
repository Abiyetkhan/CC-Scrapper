## Installation

To install `pyrofork` and `tgcrypto`, run the following command:

```bash
pip install pyrofork tgcrypto
```

**Note: If you previously installed `pyrogram`, uninstall it before installing `pyrofork`.**

## Configuration

1. Open the `config.py` file in your favorite text editor.
2. Replace the placeholders for `API_ID`, `API_HASH`, `SESSION_STRING`, `ADMIN_IDS`, `DEFAULT_LIMIT`, `ADMIN_LIMIT` and `BOT_TOKEN` with your actual values:
   - **`API_ID`**: Your API ID from [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org).
   - **`API_HASH`**: Your API Hash from [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org).
   - **`SESSION_STRING`**: The session string generated using [@SmartUtilBot](https://t.me/SmartUtilBot).
   - **`BOT_TOKEN`**: The token you obtained from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather).

3. Optionally, adjust the following settings:
   - **`ADMIN_IDS`**: List of admin user IDs who have elevated permissions.
   - **`ADMIN_LIMIT`**: The maximum number of messages admins can scrape in a single request.
   - **`DEFAULT_LIMIT`**: The maximum number of messages regular users can scrape in a single request.

## Deploy the Bot

```sh
git clone https://github.com/abirxdhack/CC-Scrapper
cd CC-Scrapper
python scrapper.py
```

## Usage

1. Use the `/scr` command followed by the group or channel username and the number of messages to scrape.

    ```text
    /scr @channel_username 1000
    ```

2. Optionally, you can scrape any target bin cards

    ```text
    /scr @channel_username 1000 434769
    ```

3. Use the `/mc` command to scrape from multiple chats:

    ```text
    /mc @channel_username @channel_username1 1000
    ```

âœ¨ **Notes**:
- Ensure the bot is an administrator in the channels/groups you want to scrape from for the best results.
- The bot can handle a high number of requests simultaneously, but it's a good practice to monitor its performance and adjust limits if necessary.
- If you encounter any issues, check the bot logs for detailed error messages.
- Keep your API credentials and session string secure to prevent unauthorized access to your bot.
